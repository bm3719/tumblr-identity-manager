This project demonstrates how to seamlessly combine a Clojure back-end with a
JavaScript front-end, in the case where data structures are shared between
layers.

Concepts covered:
- Automated case style conversion.
- Traversing forms with clojure.walk.
- Memoization and threshold profiling with clojure.core.memoize.
